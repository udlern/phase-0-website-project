        <h1 id="experience-heading">My Career: What I've Been up to</h1>
    <div>
        <div id="first-box"><p>I started working at a mental health agency, Seneca Family of Agencies, as a Health Information Specialist in March of 2020. I worked at a specific partial hospitalization program that provided daily group therapy for 10 days for youth ages 12-17 who were suffering from anxiety and depression. My job was to keep track of client files, monitor and support group therapy sessions, and communicate with clinicians, family, and clients, as needed.</p></div>
        <div id="second-box"><p>Throughout my time at Seneca, I was learning so much about working in the mental health field, but I was still struggling with what I wanted to do as a career. I thought how I wanted to impact the psychology field and what would path be the most meaningful for me, which led me to greatly consider graduate school and getting my Master’s in Social Work.</p></div>
        <div id="third-box"><p>In June of 2021, I started experimenting with the free basics of JavaScript lessons offered on Codecademy, and found out that I really enjoyed what I was doing! I had never before considered a career in tech or coding, but was beginning to see how I could combine my passion for psychology and newfound interest in coding, and use them together to create an impact on mental health on a global level!</p></div>
        <div id="fourth-box"><p>After deciding to quit my job a couple of months ago and fully commit to this career change, applying to Flatiron is the exact opportunity I was looking for. I’m so excited to be able to develop such a valuable skillset, and be able to use it to develop apps geared towards promoting and emphasizing social justice causes, as well as the people behind those causes.</p></div>
